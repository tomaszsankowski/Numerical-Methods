# Lab 6: Function Approximation

This mini-project contains MATLAB/Octave scripts for function approximation.

## Contents

- `zadanie1.m` to `zadanie5.m`: Scripts implementing polynomial approximation and calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- `energy.mat`: Data file containing energy production data.
- `print_energy.m`: Script to print energy data.
- `main.m`: Main script to run the project.

## How to run

Execute `main.m` in MATLAB or Octave.
